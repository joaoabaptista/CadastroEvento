# Event Registration System
This is a Single Page Application (SPA) for managing event registrations, built with Java (backend) and JavaScript (frontend). The project implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to create, edit, view, and delete events efficiently.

The goal of this project is to strengthen full-stack development skills, focusing on RESTful API integration, dynamic UI behavior, and clean code structure across backend and frontend layers.
 Note: This project is still a work in progress and not yet fully completed. Some features may be missing or under development.
